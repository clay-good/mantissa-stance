name: SSH access restricted from internet
description: |
  Ensure firewall rules do not allow SSH (port 22) access from the
  internet (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted SSH access exposes instances to
  brute force attacks and should be limited to specific trusted IPs.

enabled: true
severity: high

resource_type: gcp_compute_firewall

check:
  type: expression
  expression: "resource.allows_ssh_from_internet == false"

compliance:
  - framework: cis-gcp-foundations
    version: "2.0.0"
    control: "3.6"
  - framework: pci-dss
    version: "4.0"
    control: "1.3.1"
  - framework: nist-800-53
    version: "rev5"
    control: "SC-7"

remediation:
  guidance: |
    1. Navigate to VPC Network > Firewall in GCP Console
    2. Identify rules allowing SSH from 0.0.0.0/0
    3. Edit the rule to restrict source ranges to trusted IPs
    4. Consider using Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for SSH access
    5. Or use Cloud VPN/Interconnect for secure access
    6. Delete or disable unnecessary SSH rules
