name: Container images should minimize high severity vulnerabilities
description: |
  High severity vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized
  access or cause significant damage. While some high CVEs may be
  acceptable with compensating controls, they should be minimized.

  guidance: |
    1. Review high severity vulnerabilities
    2. Prioritize based on EPSS scores and KEV catalog
    3. Update vulnerable packages where fixes are available
    4. For unfixed vulns, assess risk and apply mitigations
    5. Document accepted risks with justification
    6. Re-scan after remediation
