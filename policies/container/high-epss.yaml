name: Container images should not have high EPSS score vulnerabilities
description: |
  EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) predicts the likelihood of
  a vulnerability being exploited. Vulnerabilities with high EPSS scores
  (>10%) require urgent attention regardless of CVSS severity.

remediation:
  guidance: |
    1. Review vulnerabilities with high EPSS scores
    2. EPSS >10% indicates likely exploitation
    3. Prioritize these over low-EPSS critical CVEs
    4. Apply patches or mitigations immediately
    5. Monitor for exploitation attempts
    6. Consider compensating controls while patching
