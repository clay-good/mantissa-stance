  guidance: |
    To review Bedrock model access:
    1. Audit enabled foundation models:
       - aws bedrock list-foundation-models
       - Review model capabilities and risks
    2. Disable access to unused models:
       - aws bedrock delete-model-access-permission
    3. Implement approval workflow:
       - Require justification for high-risk models
       - Document use case and safeguards
    4. Configure CloudTrail logging:
       - Monitor model invocations
       - Alert on unusual usage patterns
